# Assignment JC1a

## Task 1

1. Install `git` on your computer.
1. Create a GitHub account. Once created, you will receive a GitHub username (also known as your GitHub handle). For example, my handle is `hisplan`.
1. Going forward, whenever youâ€™re instructed to perform tasks involving `git`, ensure that you execute these commands using Terminal (on macOS) or PowerShell (on Windows).

## Task 2

1. Clone this `dscd-sandbox` repository onto your local machine.
1. Within the people directory, create a text file (.txt) named after your student ID. For example, if your student ID is `22316316`, your file should be named `22316316.txt`. Inside this file, write your full name. Do not modify or add any other files or content.
1. Commit your changes to the repository.
1. Attempt to push your changes to the remote repository. You will encounter an error at this step. Reflect on why this error occurs and determine what must be done to resolve it. Complete the necessary steps to successfully push your changes.

## Task 3

1. Create a new repository named `dscd-test` within your personal GitHub account.
1. Clone the newly created repository onto your local machine.
1. Within this repository, create a file named `test.py` and insert the following Python code:

    ```python
    def model_A():
        print("do this.")


    def model_B():
        print("do that.")


    def model_C():
        print("do other thing.")


    model_A()
    model_B()
    model_C()
    ```

1. Commit the newly added file to your repository.
1. Push your committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub.
1. Invite me as a collaborator to your repository. If I do not respond promptly to your invitation, please email me to inform me of the invitation.
1. Once I have collaborator access to your repository, we will proceed further with this assignment. Please note, this assignment is not yet complete! Make sure you check your inbox frequently!
